## Analysis of the expression profile of genes regulated by treatment with glucocorticoids and retinoic acid in lung cancer
This repository contains code and report done for the course 'Data Analysis and Exploration' during my Master in Phyaics at the University of Trento, in Italy.
Main steps of the analysis involve:
1. **Dataset preparation** -> dataset is cleaned and normalization is performed:
    - Log2 transformation
    - Rescale to a median of zero
2. **Exploratory analysis** -> consists of:
    - Principal Component Analysis
3. **Unsupervised learning methods**:
    - *K-means*
    - *Hierarchical clustering*
4. **Supervised learning methods**:
    - *Random Forest*
    - *LDA*
    - *LASSO*
    - *SCUDO*
5. **Functional enrichment analysis**:
    - *g:Profiler*
    - *STRING*
    - *PathfindR*
6. **Methylation analysis**
